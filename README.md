# Easy Vote Listener

Spigot 1.15 plugin to run commands when a player votes with votifier(or a compatable plugin like nuVotifier).

# Description
This is a very easy, highly configurable plugin to run commands when a player votes

If a player votes while offline, it will wait until the log in to process their vote.

# Usage
Vote

# Commands

`/EVL test` - `(EVL.test)` - This will simulate a vote for you, for testing purposes  
`/EVL reload` - `(EVL.reload)` - Reload the config file

# Permissions
[View permissions here](../../blob/master/src/plugin.yml)


# Installation
- Place the jar file in your plugins folder
- Restart your server
- Edit the configuration options

# Configuration

- Note that all commands will be run from the console, not the player.  
- You can set up as many permissions and commands as you would like, in the default config I have included a `EVL_player` and an `EVL_vip` permission as an example.  
- Anyone with EVL_player will have the commands under it ran, the same with vip, you can create as many permissions and commands as you would like!
